# Graph-Railway-Network-shortest-path
Django Project for computing the shortest path of a railway network which uses shortest path algorithm in a graph assuming tracks as edges. 

Technologies used: Django, HTML, CSS.

Description about technologies used:

Django is used for creating the backend of the application.

The application is used for computing the shortest path in a graph consisting of railway tracks as edges, and thus it tells us the shortest path between any two points which are involved in the query.

The queries use Dijkstra's single-source-shortest-path algorithm for computing the shortest distance in the graph.

The data used in the project has been taken from Delhi website which contains the data regarding distances of metro stations.

To start the project in your local:


-install django using official website.

-use the command after opening the project in PyCharm and moving to project directory in terminal.

### python manage.py runserver


-For making queries, head to the UI and make queries for recieving the shortest path as an output.

Thanks
